Implementation Directory
--------------------------------------

Location for datapath/processor implementation files.  Includes any other artifacts like an assembler or simulator.

This project was built from the ground up with a Memory Lab provided. Each indivicual component located in the Datapath V3
is implemented indidvisually and simulated. Subsections of the processor are built and simulated for a smaller test bed and a full
system implementation.

Our processor was tested by implementing Euclids Algorithm with different inputs. Our processor test results are listed
fully in the final design document but highlights are for the number 5040:

Avg CPI 3.83
Cycle Time: 11.871 ns = 84.24 MHz Frequency

Include:
* a Xinlinx project directory
* Your lab6-8 folders
* Assembler, simulator, compiler code and instruction manuals.
